# oex-utils
ad-hoc utilities for Open edX development

## Purpose

This repository is a place to be able to save, track, and share utilities created while working on tasks related to the Open edX project.

If a utility here proves to be useful in the long-term, it might be worth breaking it out into another repository where more formal development and maintenance processes are used.
